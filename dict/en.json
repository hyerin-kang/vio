Just as this was a turning point in my life, I hope that the journey of a company that started business in Korea but has grown to become a global manufacturer will be a small but sure hope for young people. \n\nJust as intellectual property motivated the world to spark the First, Second, and Third Industrial Revolutions, reducing the proportion of the world's population in absolute poverty from 85% to less than 9%, giving people light by which people obtain 80% of information, lowering the illiteracy rate from 90% to the 10% range and leading people to a safer life, and reducing infant mortality from 44% to less than 4%, respecting and honoring intellectual property rights will give hope to young people, accelerate creative innovations, make human life better, and create a fair society where people can move between social classes. To help make this hope a reality, I keep creating new works and fighting for intellectual property, vowing not to cut my hair until I have won each battle. \n\nPlease show your continuous interest in us and keep encouraging us in the future.",
